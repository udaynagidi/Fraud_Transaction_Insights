# 🚨 Fraud Transactions Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI project is built to analyze and visualize patterns of fraudulent transactions in financial data. The goal is to detect suspicious activity using visual insights, making it easier for analysts, investigators, and stakeholders to spot red flags, monitor trends, and improve fraud response strategies.

The dashboard helps answer key questions like:
- When and where does fraud most frequently occur?
- Are there specific transaction types or locations prone to fraud?
- How does the amount or frequency vary between legitimate and fraudulent transactions?

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains anonymized transaction records that include:
- *Transaction ID*
- *Customer ID*
- *Amount*
- *Transaction Type*
- *Merchant / Location*
- *Date & Time*
- *Fraud Label* (True/False)

It simulates real-world banking activity and is suitable for binary classification and pattern detection.

## 📈 Visualizations Used
- *Fraud vs. Non-Fraud Bar Chart* – Compare number of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.
- *Time Series Plot* – Identify spikes in fraud by date/time.
- *Heat Map* – Geographic distribution of fraud hotspots.
- *Transaction Amount Distribution* – Analyze amounts linked to fraud cases.
- *Slicer Filters* – Dynamic filters for transaction type, region, date, and customer segment.
- *KPI Cards* – Total transactions, % fraud rate, average fraud amount.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Fraudulent transactions are disproportionately higher during specific time windows (e.g., late nights).
- Certain transaction types (e.g., online purchases or specific merchant categories) show significantly more fraud.
- A small number of customers are responsible for a large share of the flagged activity.
- Average amount per fraudulent transaction is often slightly higher than regular ones, indicating targeting of mid-to-high value segments.
